# mow

## Gist

Clean up your movie-folders. Attempts to remove heavily adorned filenames as observed on the interweb. Changes the filename (of recognized entries) with sane estethics â€“ this is more useful to you and your typical movie app (Air Video HD/Plex etc).

The reason I wrote this is to have sane movie-information when I browse the filesystem on my tv.

Metadata and posters are also retrieved (when possible.)

## Forward

Broaden the extraction of meta-data.

## Requirements

Anything with a filesystem running Python 3.5

## Installation

Ready-made can be downloaded using the python [pip](https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/#install-pip) utility.

```
$> `pip install mow`
```

#### Use-case 1: **Scan**

If you have a folder with downloaded movies and you want to have readable filenames and at the same time fetch meta-data and posters. You can use `mow scan`

```shell
$> mow scan --help
Usage: mow scan [OPTIONS] INPUT OUTPUT UNKNOWN                    
                                                                  
Options:                                                          
  -r, --reset-cache  Reset cache before scanning
  --help             Show this message and exit.   
```

Go to your movie folder

```shell
$> pwd
~
$> ls ./movies-folder-source
Beau Ideal - 1931 ripped by someone.mp4

...
$> mow scan ./movie-folder-source ./output/recognized-files-folder ./output/unrecognized-files-folder
```

Output:

```shell
~/output/recognized-files-folder/.
~/output/unrecognized-files-folder/.
